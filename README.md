# Image-Classifier


<b> Part 1: Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning </b> </br>
In the first part of the project, I worked through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with TensorFlow. I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.</br>
The project is broken down into multiple steps:
<li>Load the image dataset and create a pipeline.</li>
<li>Build and Train an image classifier on this dataset.</li>
<li>Use your trained model to perform inference on flower images.</li>
